HTML Entity Populator

This Ruby project creates a Semantic Data Collection Changefile that contains
documentation for the encoding of HTML entities.

To run:

  ruby populator.rb

should create the file html_entities.json.json.bz2, which can be uploaded to
Solve for All as a Semantic Data Collection Changefile.

For more documentation on Semantic Data Collections see
https://solveforall.com/docs/developer/semantic_data_collection

More aliases could be added, and any enhancements are welcome! Please submit your pull request and if accepted, it will
improve the content on Solve for All.
